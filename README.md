# Touch your Face => Post Cringe Tweet

Train your monkey brain to stop your hands from touching your face. ðŸ™Š<br>
Basically, if you touch your face, a Twitter bot ðŸ¤– I made posts a random tweet from a **chef kiss* *  fine selection of embarrassing posts.

## How to use
To run this app locally: 
1. `git clone` the [Cringe Tweet Bot](https://github.com/dharmadeveloper108/cringe_tweet_bot) (or download the project) and `npm start` it; 

1. Download or `git clone` this repo;

1. Then just open the "index.html" (ideally on Chrome, works fine on Firefox and Edge too).

And voilÃ , you have your wicked face-touching deterrent up and running. ðŸ‘Œ
